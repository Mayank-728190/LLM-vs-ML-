# 🚀 Comparing LLM vs ML for Small Datasets

![Machine Learning vs LLM](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Neural_Network_Model.svg/800px-Neural_Network_Model.svg.png)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores the effectiveness of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** versus traditional **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques on a structured healthcare dataset containing approximately **300,000 rows with 36 features**. The study aims to evaluate **performance, accuracy, and efficiency** of both approaches for small dataset applications.

## 📂 Files
📁 `HealthCareML.ipynb` - Implements traditional ML models on the dataset.  
📁 `beyondthehypellm_main.ipynb` - Utilizes LLM-based approaches for comparison.  
📷 `results/` - Stores comparison graphs and images.

## 🎯 Objectives
✔️ Compare model performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.).  
✔️ Analyze computational efficiency and resource usage.  
✔️ Determine feasibility of LLMs for structured tabular data.

## 🛠 Methodology
### 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing
🔹 Handle missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding.  
🔹 Feature scaling and engineering.

### 2️⃣ ML Approach
🔹 Models: **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.**  
🔹 Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.

### 3️⃣ LLM Approach
🔹 **Using prompt engineering** to analyze patterns.  
🔹 Fine-tuning or zero-shot learning for prediction.

### 4️⃣ Evaluation Metrics
📊 Compare results based on performance scores and inference time.

## 📈 Results & Findings
✅ ML models showed **faster training times** and **higher structured-data accuracy**.  
✅ LLMs demonstrated potential but required **fine-tuning for better results**.  
✅ Trade-offs exist between **interpretability, computational cost, and scalability**.

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Use
1️⃣ Open the respective `.ipynb` files in **Jupyter Notebook** or **Google Colab**.  
2️⃣ Ensure required libraries are installed:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3️⃣ Run the notebooks step by step and compare outputs.

## 📦 Dependencies
- 🐍 Python 3.x  
- 📊 Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost  
- 🤖 Transformers (for LLM-based analysis)  

## 🏆 Conclusion
💡 While ML models are still **more efficient for small structured datasets**, LLMs show promise in certain scenarios where **feature extraction and adaptability** are crucial.

## 🔮 Future Work
🚀 Explore **hybrid models combining ML with LLMs**.  
📌 Test on **different domains beyond healthcare**.  
⚡ Optimize **LLMs for better structured data handling**.
